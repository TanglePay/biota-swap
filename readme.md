# Bridge From IOTA to Shimmer evm

## Prepare for this service
### 1. One of the validaters must install mysql service. The database name is "smpc". Create a table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE `swap_order` (
  `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `txid` varchar(512) NOT NULL,     /*txid is the messageID or hash in the iota network or shimmer evm network*/
  `src_token` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `dest_token` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `wrap` tinyint NOT NULL DEFAULT '1' COMMENT '1: wrap, -1: unwrap',
  `from` varchar(512) NOT NULL,
  `to` varchar(512) NOT NULL,
  `amount` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `hash` varchar(512) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `state` tinyint NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `ts` bigint NOT NULL,
  `order_time` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `txid` (`txid`),
  KEY `txid_select` (`txid`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```
### 2. Create ethereum wallet
Every validater must generate several wallets. One is for the smpc, and others for the evm MutliSignWallet. All the wallets must use one password to encrypt the keystore files. 
One of the keystore file:
```json
{
    "address": "d0928162bd6fe945125e3b3e15f77f6d7de45ff5",
    "crypto": {
        "cipher": "aes-128-ctr",
        "ciphertext": "49e8258ffcd4b9a613aa7730676480f2a49663531c6688a9a66984c12b5af9be",
        "cipherparams": {
            "iv": "dd48c82ea37283dc9f089f5cc45ad1e0"
        },
        "kdf": "scrypt",
        "kdfparams": {
            "dklen": 32,
            "n": 262144,
            "p": 1,
            "r": 8,
            "salt": "9e24a2ed36c4c8a22b7e5c893a1cbdb50a7929ff9c6d297285e2c7d05c0f0ab1"
        },
        "mac": "3e4c790f4b6314d2ffe4cd95c4362085f94f545637d15c86da72186d95147162"
    },
    "id": "2f5495c1-4886-4711-b217-3eb83f0fb72c",
    "version": 3
}
```

### 3. Start the smpc service.
* One of the validaters run the "bootnode" to create a bootnodes info and send it to other validaters.
* All the validaters start the mpc service by running the "gsmpc".
* One of the validaters request a group id and a sub group id and send them to other validaters.
* One of the validaters request some public keys by running "gsmpc-client" and send them to other valildaters.
* Other validaters should accept the request in time when one of them request gourp id or public key.
* The addresses of all the MutliSignWallets must send to TanglePay to create contract on evm.
* TanglePay send the evm contract address to all the validaters.
Detail infomation for this, can see [smpc-node keygen and sign workflow](https://github.com/TanglePay/smpc-node).

### 4. Config the bridge service
Before run this service, you must fill the config/conf.toml file with the right parameter. Detail is in the exmaple conf.toml file.

## Run the Bridge service
```shell
go build -ldflags "-w -s"
./bwrap -d
```
Stop the service
```shell
./stop.sh
```

## Aes encrypt/decrypt in tools/aes.go
### introduction
As an infrastructure within the community, security is our top concern. Currently, there are three layers of security for the nodes:
* First, the MPC mechanism is a form of security protection. In 4/6, a hacker would need to breach four validators. In the future, we will add a bounty to reward attackers who can breach a validator, so that we can promptly adjust for risky validators.
* Second, the server on which each validator is located provides another layer of protection. Validators have the duty to protect their own servers from being breached.
* Third, each validator starts its service with a password. In many MPC platforms, passwords are stored in configuration files. However, in our system design, once the password is entered, it doesnâ€™t exist outside the memory, thereby increasing security.

To further enhance the security, we suggest a fourth mechanism: in the latest version of the bridge, the password is no longer exposed in memory but is encrypted using an encryption algorithm provided in the function createKey(). Even if an attacker gains access to the data in memory, he cannot obtain the password without cracking the encryption.
  
However, the effectiveness of this layer of protection depends on the attacker not knowing the encryption algorithm. Since the current method is semi-public (at least all of us validators can now see this algorithm), this layer of protection is not fully meaningful. To achieve maximum protection, validators can rewrite the function createkey() and implement an encryption algorithm that is different from each other, which will provide a unique layer of protection.

Although validators can now provide stable services without rewriting the encryption algorithm, in the aspect of protecting the community and user assets, we still recommend validators do so.
### example of CreateKey
```go
func CreateKey(seed uint64, nSize uint64) []byte {
	if (nSize != 16) && (nSize != 32) && (nSize != 64) {
		return nil
	}
	data := make([]byte, nSize*4)
	for i := uint64(0); i < nSize*4; i++ {
		d := seed+i
		data[i] = uint8(d % 256)
	}
	var hs hash.Hash
	switch nSize {
	case 16:
		hs = md5.New()
	case 32:
		hs = sha256.New()
	case 64:
		hs = sha512.New()
	default:
		return nil
	}
	hs.Write(data)
	return hs.Sum(nil)
}
```
Function objective :
* input a seed of random uint64
* return a key for []byte with a 16 bytes length.
  
like the function above, you can rewrite the formula `d`
```go
	d := seed+i
```
to more complex formula, as follows. The more complex of the formula, the safer of the algorithm.
```go
	d := seed*math.Sin(i)
	d = seed * math.Cos(i) + i * seed
```
